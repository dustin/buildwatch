			BuildWatch watches a <a href="http://buildbot.net/">buildbot</a> instance
			and lets you know when builds are running and when they succeed or fail.

			This software was written by <a href="mailto:dustin@spy.net">Dustin
			Sallings</a> for personal and educational use.  It may also be used for
			anything else you feel like doing with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			This software uses <a href="http://growl.info/">growl</a> and <a
			href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">twisted</a> and all kinds of other
			stuff.

			The LED manipulation code was written by <a

			Singh</a>.  It's great for people like me who map their caps lock to
			control so that it's useful.  :)
